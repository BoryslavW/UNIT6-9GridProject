    // spawn facing a certain direction with a higher probability to somewhat face the player
    // the npcs attack directly in the way they are facing, either 5 or 6 block range, if an npc
    // hits another npc they are counted as hit and taken out, everything has one health with the
    // player included


    // the player can attack in a 3x3 grid, they have to plan theres moves to not be hit


    // maybe two modes separated by 2 different windows or maybe a reset window, after a certain amount
    // of turns you unlock the boss battle, in which the player moves freely and has diagonal or expanding
    // attacks launched at them
